3D print files for radiator valve knob replacement (MetroEra)

This repository comtains the 3D print files for a replacement radiator valve knob for a standard small-bore MetroEra radiator valve, as commercial replacements are no longer available.
The repository contains the main blender file, together with the derived stl and cura slicer files last used to create the object.
Note that 1 metre in the blend file represents 1mm on the printed object.
